# MongoDB $lookup and $unwind Error Handling

This example demonstrates a common error when using MongoDB's aggregation framework with `$lookup` and `$unwind`. The issue arises when there's a lack of matching documents in the joined collection, leading to failures in the `$unwind` stage.

## Problem
The provided `bug.js` file showcases a pipeline using `$lookup` to join two collections and `$unwind` to process the results. If no matching document exists in the target collection for a particular entry in the source collection, the `$unwind` operation throws an error, halting the entire aggregation process.
